# Happy Camper Helper App

# Project Pitch
Set off on the trails to your campsite knowing that you have the right gear with you. Our Happy Camper Helper App will show you the gear you will need for the specific season you’ll be camping in. Click on a season, browse the items you will need, then click on the item to get it added to your list. Unable to find the item? You can add the particular item you will need via our form for that specific season. Lower your stress of trying to figure out what you need and have the app guide you on your way.

# User Stories

- As a user, I can view suggested packing lists for different camping seasons.
- Once I see a season’s list, I can add an item I need to buy into ‘My Cart’.
- I can view saved items in ‘My Cart’ as a gallery.
- If there is an item I need that is not included in the suggested packing list, I can also create a new custom item that will be added/visible in ‘My Cart’.
